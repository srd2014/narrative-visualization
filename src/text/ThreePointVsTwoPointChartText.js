          <p>
            Almost within the first couple years of the 3-point shot being introduced you can see total volume of 
            2 point field goal attmepts start to decrease. Prior to 1979, shots in the post (within the free throw line)
            were the most popular -- not making for exciting basketball viewing.

            Around 2010, we started to see 3-point shot volume increase at a steeper rate then decades before. There are 
            various reasons for this, but we can identify more skilled/shooting-focused teams like the Golden State Warriors and shooting big men as 
            potential reasons why the 3-pointer started to gain popularity during this time.
