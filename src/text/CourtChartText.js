    <h1>A Primer on the 3-point Shot in Basketball</h1>
    <h3><u>Part 1: Origin Story</u></h3>
    <div style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>
        <p>
          The three point shot has evolved over the years. It started before the NBA in the ABL (American Basketball League)
          which survived only for 1.5 seasons before folding. The ABA (American Basketball Association) was the league that originally 
          conceived the 3-pointer. George Mikan, founder of the ABA, referenced the new shot as the "home run" of basketball bringing fans out of their seats. 
          Although the NBA and ABA merger in 1976 didn't include the 3 point shot, it was officially included as part of the 1979-1980 season.
          <br/><br/>
          From then on, it was included in all variations of the sport at different levels - high school, college, WNBA, and
          international play. At this point, it's less of a spectacle and more of a standard part of any offense. It changes the 
          game as players are not incentivized to shoot close to the basket (for layups and dunks) but attempt to make 1.5x 
          as many points by hitting shots outside the arc.
